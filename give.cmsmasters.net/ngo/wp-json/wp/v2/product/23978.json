To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.

The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc. Europe uses the same vocabulary European languages are members of the same family.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.
